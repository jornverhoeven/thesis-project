\section{Research Method}
The thesis primarily focuses on implementing and experimenting with the ADRIAN protocol. This protocol is theorized to overcome the problems that were mentioned in the sections before. We think that first creating an attack graph using predefined risk rules should allow any nodes within the network to assess the risk, in a localized portion of the network. We also think that allowing neighbouring agents to propose mitigations will reduce the overall risk of the network. 

To initiate, experiment with and refine the protocol we will perform a

    \item Literature study
    \item Define hypotheses
    \item Experiments
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Literature Study}
An initial literature study is done to investigate the current bleeding-edge technology and recent literature for risk assessment and mitigation strategies. We apply the knowledge from this literature study together with the ADRIAN protocol to create a proof of concept that combines the hypothesized strengths (Subsection~\ref{ssec:hypothesis}). This proof of concept is then used to evaluate the proposed protocol by running several experiments (Subsection~\ref{ssec:experiments}).

\subsection{Hypothesis} \label{ssec:hypothesis}
As explained in Section \ref{sec:problem-analysis}, existing research has been done to do risk identification and intrusion detection. We however want to have a decentralized network of agents to attempt to solve this problem together. We hypothesise that by letting agents within a network communicate and negotiate with one another according to the proposed protocol, the overall risk probability of a network will decrease. 

We think that having agents calculate Attack Graphs based on a local knowledge base allows the agents of a network to identify risks accurately and efficiently. We will experiment with different variables, such as the distance each agent can communicate (See Section \ref{ssec:experiments}), to analyze the impact of different strategies. This research aims to investigate the overall effect of this method, and will not be an exhaustive list of possible strategies. 

Additionally, we think that allowing agents to propose solutions to identified risks (through auctions) will decrease the overall risk probability. 


\subsection{Experiments} \label{ssec:experiments}
In order to validate the hypothesis and answer the research questions a Proof of Concept (PoC) will be created as explained in Section \ref{sec:expected-results}. This PoC allows us to execute several experiments in a controlled environment, where we can simulate different networks and events. Each experiment is performed over multiple epochs. We define an epoch as a time window with an initial infrastructure which can be changed by agents by means of adaptations. This initial infrastructure can be different in each subsequent epoch, based on these mutations. No new infrastructure nodes or software components are added during an epoch. If mutations to the infrastructure should be considered, they are added to the initial infrastructure of the subsequent epoch.

\subsubsection{Control Experiment} 
To evaluate the quality of our proposed protocol we want to perform a control experiment. This experimental setup allows nodes to apply predefined adaptation patterns to the properties and attributes of the node it is running on, just like in our proposal. However, the agents are not allowed to communicate with its neighbours. What this effectively simulates is a network in which agents only identify and mitigate risks on its own hosting node. 

In our controlled environment, we can still calculate the overall risk probability and measure it over time. Thinks to consider when measuring are (but not limited to); Amount of adaptations, total number of risks identified, number of remaining risks, and the sum of the damage for remaining risks.

\subsubsection{Broadcasting range}
Agents will be able to communicate with other agents in the network within an exchange range of \( Range(n) \), where \(n\) is a number representing the maximum distance (shortest path) between nodes. In our control experiment we effectively set \( Range(0) \) for the entire network, meaning that no knowledge is shared between nodes. \( Range(1) \) means that knowledge is shared between immediate neighbours. 
In this experiment we aim to evaluate the impact and cost of different knowledge exchange ranges. For this experiment we attempt different ranges, and measure the effects over time. Thinks to consider when measuring are (but not limited to); the Amount of adaptations, the total number of messages exchanged, total number of risks identified, number of remaining risks, and the sum of the damage for remaining risks.

\question{Maybe it would be interesting to investigate the option where an agent can 'vouch' for another node. Sometimes Agents cannot be run on an actual node. With the abstraction it doesn't really matter too much. But from a practical point of view, it might be an interesting concept.}
