\section*{Abstract}
With the ever growing size of \textit{the cloud} we are now, more than ever, in need of systems that can help keep our infrastructure and data safe. In this thesis we propose an implementation of a multi-agent system that is able to detect risks and negotiate on different adaptations strategies that can be autonomously applied to reduce the estimated damage. Through a software realization of the ADRIAN protocol, we show that the agents are able to keep the damage of the infrastructure at a low level, while also keeping the time spent adapting low. By running the software in a multitude of scenarios with different features enabled we can quantify the performance of the overall protocol. The implementation of, and the ADRIAN protocol itself, both have some limitations that are discussed in this thesis. But overall we believe that the ADRIAN protocol has great potential to be used in real-world scenarios.
