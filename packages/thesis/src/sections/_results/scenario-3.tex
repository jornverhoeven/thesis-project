Figure \ref{fig:risk-remaining-growing} has a scale that is almost $60$ times larger than all other scenarios, and has found $212$ times more risks than initially. This can be explained by the growing size of the infrastructure, and the new edges that are introduced. A risk is defined as a path from an infrastructure node to a critical software component. As the infrastructure grows, the amount of possible paths grows exponentially. This is why the amount of risks detected is also growing exponentially. 

It should be noted that the probability and damage value of many of these risks are very low, as these critical paths can become long. This could be a reason why the overall damage (figure \ref{fig:overall-damage-growing}) is only $30$ times larger than at the start of the scenario. However, the metrics that are collected are not enough to determine the exact cause of this difference.
