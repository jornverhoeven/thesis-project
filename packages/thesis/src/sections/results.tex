\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In this section we present the results of the experiments defined in section \ref{sec:experiments}. The results will be grouped per scenario. We start by presenting overall damage of the system in each of the scenarios, as it is the key indicator of the performance of the system. We then present the other metrics that we defined in section \ref{ssec:metrics}.
